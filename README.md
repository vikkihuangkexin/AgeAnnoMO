# Introduction
Aging is characterized by a gradual functional deterioration in organisms, influenced by interconnected factors on multi-levels, including molecular, cellular and systemic levels. The common denominators that drive aging have been identified as the hallmarks of aging, such as genomic instability, epigenetic alteration, loss of proteostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, altered intercellular communication and dysbiosis (Hallmarks of aging: An expanding universe). The intricate interplay between these hallmarks contributes to the multifaceted nature of aging, and highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms to develop effective strategies for healthy aging and age-related disease prevention.


Our comprehensive database, AgeAnnoMO, includes genetic and mitochondrial genomes, transcriptomes, epigenomes, proteomes, immunomes, microbiomes, and metabolomes. We annotated 7,530 genes, 878 metabolites, 18 mitochondrial genes, 393 microbiotas, 229,413 age-specific TCR sequences, and 1,391 age-specific BCR sequences from 8 aging-related databases and studies. AgeAnnoMO houses 138 datasets, including 48 species, 8,525 samples, 60 tissues, and 1,044,141 cells. Moreover, we also identified the integration between aging hallmarks. AgeAnnoMO provides a wide range of annotations for aging regulators, offering valuable insights into the aging process.
