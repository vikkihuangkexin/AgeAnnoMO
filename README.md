Aging is the gradual functional deterioration influenced by interconnected factors. Multiple hallmarks have been proposed as common underlying denominators of aging. These hallmarks are demonstrated to be remarkable conservation across multiple species. For instance, activation of the protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is shown conservation in cellular metabolism regulation of aging across multiple species such as yeast, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, mice, monkeys, and humans. After discovered the effect of Rapamysins on lifespan extension by targeting the TOR pathway in yeast, extensive experiments in model organisms continually indicated the promising potential of Rapamycins on anti-aging. Moreover, the interactions between gut microbiota composition, mTOR, and lifespan has been studied in mice and non-human primates, shedding light on the effects of gut microbiota on longevity through the mTOR pathway. These evidence demonstrate that understanding the regulation of aging factors and their relationships across species can facilitate the translation of anti-aging drug development from model organisms to humans.

Our comprehensive database, AgeAnnoMO, includes genetic and mitochondrial genomes, transcriptomes, epigenomes, proteomes, immunomes, microbiomes, and metabolomes. We annotated 7,530 genes, 878 metabolites, 18 mitochondrial genes, 393 microbiotas, 229,413 age-specific TCR sequences, and 1,391 age-specific BCR sequences from 8 aging-related databases and studies. AgeAnnoMO houses 138 datasets, including 48 species, 8,525 samples, 60 tissues, and 1,044,141 cells. Moreover, we also identified the integration between aging hallmarks. AgeAnnoMO provides a wide range of annotations for aging regulators, offering valuable insights into the aging process
